Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.

CS2107 Introduction to Computer Security
This module serves as an introductory module on information security. It illustrates the fundamentals of how systems fail due to malicious activities and how they can be protected. The module also places emphasis on the practices of secure programming and implementation. Topics covered include classical/historical ciphers, introduction to modern ciphers and cryptosystems, ethical, legal and organisational aspects, classic examples of direct attacks on computer systems such as input validation vulnerability, examples of other forms of attack such as social engineering/phishing attacks, and the practice of secure programming.
